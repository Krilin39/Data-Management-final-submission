Earing design tool - collaborative workflow

The tool aims to help designers have a common platform to visualize the state of a design that is subject to continuous changes and different options.

The app can be used to inform a design idea before it is released into the desired market. It uses the Rhino 3dm library to visualize accurate models and the power of option exploration through grasshopper parametric design. 

The future aim is for the unity platform to make changes and experience the tool in real-time, for example, VR, and push the state of the design to the web through Github.


The earing design tool is a project of IAAC, Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia developed in the Master In Advanced Computation For Architecture & Design 2021/2022 by student: Erida Bendo and Faculty: David Andres Leon, Hesham Shawqy.
